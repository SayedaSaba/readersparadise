# Open Source Task

Welcome to the **Open Source Task**! 👋  
This guide will help you understand the basics of **Git** and **GitHub**, helping you get started with version control and open-source collaboration.

## 🧠 **What is Git?**  
Git is the most commonly used version control system. It tracks changes made to files, allowing you to maintain a history of updates and revert to previous versions if needed. Git makes collaboration easier by enabling multiple people to work on the same project and merge their changes seamlessly.

### 📥 **How to Install Git**  
1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download Git for your computer.  
2. During installation, you’ll see an option to select the **default branch name** (as shown below):  
   - ✅ **Select "Override the default branch name for new repositories."**  
   - ✅ Type **"main"** in the box.
