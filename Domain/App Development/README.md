## What is App Development?

App Development is the process of building software applications that run on mobile devices (Android/iOS). It involves:

- **UI/UX Design**: Crafting interfaces that are user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **Frontend App Logic**: Handling user interactions, navigation, and rendering views.
- **Backend Integration**: Connecting to databases, APIs, and authentication services.
